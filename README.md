# Exno.3-Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques                                                   
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223240050
### Aim: 
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:

1. Define the Scenario and Use Case
Scenario:
In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, people are increasingly health-conscious and want to know the nutritional information of the food they consume. Restaurants, cafeterias, and online food services require an automated system to present food menu details clearly and attractively.

Use Case:
The system will generate a nutritional chart for food menus that includes calories, protein, fat, and allergens. This structured representation helps customers make informed choices.

Target Audience:

Restaurants and Cafeterias
Online Food Delivery Platforms
Health-conscious customers

2. Main Objectives
📊 Provide a structured nutritional chart for various dishes.
🍴 Help users easily identify ingredients, calorie intake, and proteins.
⚠️ Highlight allergen information for customer safety.
🌟 Present data in a colorful and user-friendly format.

3. Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect

⚠️ Highlight allergen information for customer safety.
🌟 Present data in a colorful and user-friendly format.

3. Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect

💡 Idea Generation Prompts

Prompt: “What features should be included in a food menu nutritional chart in tabular format?”
Generated Ideas:
Dish name with short description and main ingredients.
Nutritional values: Calories, Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, Fiber.
Special highlights for allergen information (like gluten, dairy, nuts, soy).
A standardized table structure for quick comparison.
Symbols or color highlights for health categories (✔ High Protein, 🟢 Low Fat).
Add a column for “Dietary Suitability” (e.g., Vegan, Vegetarian, Keto-friendly).

👩‍💻 Persona and Context Prompts
Prompt: “What should the nutritional chart convey to the end-user?”
Generated Context:
Customers must feel the chart is reliable and accurate.
It should support dietary decision-making (weight loss, bodybuilding, etc.).
The design should be simple so even non-technical users understand it.
Provide trust and transparency from the restaurant or provider.
Support quick scanning of dishes (people don’t read long paragraphs).
Encourage healthier choices by showing comparisons side by side.

🎨 Structural / Formatting Prompts

Prompt: “How should the nutritional data be displayed for maximum clarity?”
Generated Structures:
A clean, tabular format with consistent alignment.
Use headers for each nutritional category.
Keep units standardized (kcal, grams).
Separate allergens in a distinct column or highlight them.
Optionally include icons for vegetarian 🌱, vegan 🥗, or non-veg 🍗 dishes.

📊 Analytical / Expansion Prompts

Prompt: “How can the chart provide more than just numbers?”
Generated Enhancements:
Include daily value percentages (e.g., 15% of daily protein needs).
Add health labels like “Low Carb,” “Heart Healthy,” or “High Fiber.”
Group dishes by category (Starters, Mains, Desserts).
Show comparisons (this dish vs. average daily needs).
Provide diet recommendations (e.g., good for post-workout meals).

Example Combined Prompt Workflow

Idea Prompt: Generate list of essential columns for nutritional chart.
Persona Prompt: Adjust columns for user needs (diet-conscious, allergen-sensitive).
Structural Prompt: Format in table with aligned headers.
Analytical Prompt: Enrich table with health labels and dietary suitability.

Conclusion
The various types of prompts—Idea Generation, Persona and Context, Structural/Formatting, and Analytical/Expansion—were successfully applied to design the Food Menu Nutritional Chart. Each prompt type contributed a unique role: generating essential features, aligning content with user needs, structuring the data for clarity, and enriching it with meaningful insights. The final chart provides a clear, structured, and visually appealing presentation of nutritional information. This enables customers to make healthier food choices while ensuring safety through allergen awareness.
